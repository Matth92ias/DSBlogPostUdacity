I just started Udacitys Data Science Nanodegree
interesting challenge to investigate data from airbnb
posed different questions which I want to

I myself come from a R background and haven't done too much in Python yet. I am excited
to learn more and get to really work with Python. What I found quite interesting that
there is a Python plotnine with which you can create
beautiful ggplot2 graphics.

So lets get started

I was interested in the development of prices over the year. As you can see from Jun
- August prices are highest. Interesting to see is also that the number of listings
peaks in highest in December, but also has a peak in March.
One reason could be that as for example in March demand is lower and hosts arent
too booked out yet, they try to get people with lower prices. Especially in the summer
month when demand increases also the prices increase

What is that about?
Wanted to investigate how much hosts change their prices. The median of hosts only
varies the price by ten dollar. Over 25  % percent of the hosts increase the price
by more than 45 Dollars. It is also again interesting to see comparing the months
of min prices against max prices. And as already from the first analysis expected
people usually tend to have their offer lower prices in Winter Month

This was more about differences in prices over the year. Another very interesting question
is what drives prices in general?
For this purpose I want to fit a model trying to predict prices of hosts.
