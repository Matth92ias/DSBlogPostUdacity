# DSBlogPostUdacity

This is the code I have written to complete the first course of the Nanodegree
Data Scientist from Udacity. I have saved the data in the directory data. The
datasets are also available on the following page:

The medium article is published on the following webpage:

The necessary packages are specified in the requirements.txt file. The project
includes two notebooks which are saved in the notebooks directory.

For the project it was necessary to follow the CRISP DM workflow:
- Business Question: Identify business questions you want to answer
- Understand the data
- Prepare the data
- Model the data
- Evaluate the result of the model
- deploy the model

In my first notebook PriceDifferences I only posted business questions and
answered these with graphics. Therefore it was necessary to understand the data
(e.g. how it is formatted,what do the columns mean). The next step was to
prepare the data in such a way that the graphics could be created

In the second notebook FitPriceModel I also fitted simple models. Thus after
modeling the data it was still necessary to evaluate the results. As this is
nothing which is supposed to be used productively the last step is not
necessary.

In general the following three business questions were investigated:
- How do prices change over the year? 
- How do the number of available listings change over the year? 
- What generally drives prices of listings?

In the notebook PriceDifferences I also checked how prices of individual users
change. I did not include this into the blog Post.
